# Public Company Data Enrichment

This directory contains evaluation script for evaluating an agent on how well it does at researching information about a public company.

## Dataset

The dataset used can be found [here](https://smith.langchain.com/public/640df79c-1831-494e-8824-d7300205dc8e/d). This dataset has a list of publicly traded companies to extract the following fields for:
  - `name`
  - `description`
  - `website`
  - `linkedin_profile`
  - `headquarters`
  - `employee_count`
  - `ceo`

## Evaluation Metric

Currently there is a single evaluation metric: fraction of the fields that were correctly extracted (per company). Correctness is defined differently depending on the field type:

- exact matches for fields like  `website`
- fuzzy matches for fields like `company_name` / `ceo`
- embedding similarity for fields like `description`
- checking within a certain tolerance (+/- 10%) for fields like `employee_count`

These can be adjusted in the `run_eval.py` script if you're adapting this to your own dataset.

## Invoking the agent

The agent is invoked using a `RemoteGraph`:

```python
from langgraph.pregel.remote import RemoteGraph

agent_graph = RemoteGraph(agent_id, url=agent_url)
agent_graph.invoke(inputs)
```

### Using different agent schema

Your agent might be using a custom input/output schema that doesn't match the dataset schema. To handle this, you can modify `transform_dataset_inputs` and `transform_agent_outputs` in `run_eval.py` in the following way:

```python

def transform_dataset_inputs(inputs: dict) -> dict:
    """Transform LangSmith dataset inputs to match the agent's input schema before invoking the agent."""
    # see the `Example input` for reference on what `inputs` dict will look like
    return {"my_agent_key": inputs["company"], ...}


def transform_agent_outputs(outputs: dict) -> dict:
    """Transform agent outputs to match the LangSmith dataset output schema."""
    # see the `Example output` for reference on what the output from `run_agent` would look like
    return {"info": response["my_agent_output_key"]}
```

`transform_dataset_inputs` will be applied to LangSmith dataset inputs before invoking the agent, and `transform_agent_outputs` will be applied to the agent's response before it's compared to the expected output in the LangSmith eval dataset.

## Running evals

To evaluate the agent, you can run `public_company_data_enrichment/run_eval.py` script. This will create new experiments in LangSmith for the two [datasets](#datasets) mentioned above.

By default this will use the `Public Company Data Enrichment` dataset & `Company mAIstro` agent by LangChain.

```shell
python public_company_data_enrichment/run_eval.py --experiment-prefix "My custom prefix"
```

You can pass the following parameters to customize the evaluation:

- `--dataset-name`: Name of the dataset to evaluate against. Defaults to `Public Company Data Enrichment` dataset.
- `--graph-id`: graph ID of the agent to evaluate. Defaults to `company_maistro`.
- `--agent-url`: URL of the deployed agent to evaluate. Defaults to `Company mAIstro` deployment.
- `--experiment-prefix`: Prefix for the experiment name.

### Testing the agent locally

#### Import agent

You can import the compiled LangGraph graph object corresponding to your agent and that as `agent_graph` in `run_eval.py` instead of `RemoteGraph`. Then you can run the evaluation script as usual - `graph-id` and `agent-url` params will be ignored.

#### Run local LangGraph server

You can test the agent locally by using [LangGraph CLI](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/langgraph-platform/local-server/#launch-langgraph-server). From the directory that contains the `langgraph.json` configuration file, run

```shell
langgraph dev
```

This will start a local server that you can interact with using `RemoteGraph`.

Then simply pass local URL for `agent-url` parameter and run the evaluation script as before:

```shell
python public_company_data_enrichment/run_eval.py --experiment-prefix "My custom prefix" --agent-url http://localhost:8123
```
